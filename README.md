Hello, To make the application just type in the code u made on the textbox, then press "Click Here For Link" then copy the code you put on the text box and paste it on pastebin then make up a title and press "create new paste" send it out to friends and enjoy!

by the way, for some reason it has a "false positive" we are not meant to make a virus! when we were testing, it also said that it was a virus but it didnt do anything!
so yeah, if it shows that its a "virus" dont trust the windows defender, its fake
